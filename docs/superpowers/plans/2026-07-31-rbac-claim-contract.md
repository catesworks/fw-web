# RBAC claim contract — Phase 0.1

**Status:** decision doc, awaiting sign-off. No code. Blocks both execution lanes.

This is the artifact Phase 0.1 of `2026-07-31-central-rbac.md` calls for: the
exact definition of the claim rolodex writes and five apps read. Everything
downstream either writes or parses this, so it is specified before any of it.

---

## 1. The contract

```jsonc
// auth.users.raw_app_meta_data
{
  "provider": "custom:fleetworks", // Supabase-owned, never touched by us
  "providers": ["email", "custom:fleetworks"],
  "fleetworks": {
    // rolodex-owned subtree, sole writer
    "v": 1,
    "roles": ["org:contributor"], // AuthRole[] only
    "source": "rolodex",
    "syncedAt": "2026-07-31T18:04:22Z",
  },
}
```

| field      | rule                                                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| path       | `app_metadata.fleetworks`                                                       |
| `v`        | schema version, integer. Unknown version ⇒ **ignore the whole subtree**         |
| `roles`    | `AuthRole[]`. Anything not in the vocabulary is dropped, not passed through     |
| `source`   | provenance. Only `"rolodex"` is honoured today                                  |
| `syncedAt` | RFC 3339 with an **explicit** offset (`Z` or `±HH:MM`). Absent ⇒ treat as stale |

**`syncedAt` must carry an explicit offset, and readers must enforce it.**
`Date.parse` follows ECMA-262: a date-time string with no offset is parsed as
**reader-local** time. Measured on `America/Los_Angeles`, `"2026-07-31T12:00:00"`
resolves 7 hours later than the same string with `Z` — so a 9-hour-stale claim
reads as 2 hours old and is accepted. Negative-offset zones fail **open**, which
is every US deployment. A reader that only checks `Date.parse` didn't return
`NaN` has not validated anything. Reject a missing offset, and reject the legacy
formats `Date.parse` also swallows (`"Jul 31 2026 20:00:00 GMT"` parses fine).

**Sole writer: the rolodex reconcile loop.** No other process writes
`app_metadata.fleetworks`. Break-glass does not live here (§4).

**Replacement, not union.** `roles` is written wholesale each reconcile. An array
union can never revoke — this is the same defect as `enforcement: 'additive'`,
one layer up. The _subtree_ is replaced; the surrounding `app_metadata` object is
merged, so `provider` / `providers` survive.

**Staleness.** A consumer that sees `syncedAt` older than **3× the reconcile
period** (3h at the agreed hourly floor) must **ignore the subtree entirely** and
fall back to local `org_members`. Note what this deliberately does _not_ say: it
does not floor the principal at `org:viewer`. Flooring would strip a
locally-granted admin during a rolodex outage, which is exactly the failure the
union precedence exists to prevent.

---

## 2. Why not the two obvious paths

**`app_metadata.roles`** — the `SupabasePlugin` default (`supabase.ts:23`), so it
needs no configuration. Rejected: it is an unnamespaced bag with no owner. Under
`enforcement: 'full'` the reconciler would compute drift against roles it did not
grant and strip them. Ownership is the whole point of §2 of the plan.

**`app_metadata.groups`** — what yellow-pages reads today (`middleware.ts:93`).
Rejected: `groups` carries raw external group names and is load-bearing for
`write-guard.ts:35` (`groups.length > 0` **is** the write grant). Writing
directory data into it grants write to every member of any AD group. That is the
escalation Phase 1.2 exists to remove; it must not be re-created here.

---

## 3. This needs a new plugin, not configuration

`SupabasePlugin.resolve` is exactly `extractStrings(getNestedClaim(payload, roleClaim))`
(`supabase.ts:26-38`) — one dot-path in, strings out. Consequences:

- **It cannot read `syncedAt`.** Staleness is unenforceable through it. Pointing
  it at `app_metadata.fleetworks.roles` gets the roles and silently discards
  every other guarantee in §1.
- **Misconfiguring the path one level up fails silently and weirdly.** Aimed at
  `app_metadata.fleetworks`, `extractStrings` returns `Object.keys()`
  (`claim-utils.ts:26-28`) — `["v","roles","source","syncedAt"]` — as if they were
  group names.
- **A missing subtree yields `[]`**, which floors to `org:viewer`
  (`orchestrator.ts:37`). Indistinguishable from "correctly has no roles."
- **`AuthRole` passthrough is unmediated** (`mapping.ts:63-66`): any string that
  is literally `org:admin` becomes `org:admin` with no rule configured.

**Deliverable: `FleetworksClaimPlugin` in `@cogs/auth`** — roughly 30 lines,
implementing the existing `RoleProviderPlugin` interface so it drops into the
plugin arrays all four AuthRole apps already build. It must:

1. read the whole `app_metadata.fleetworks` subtree, not one path;
2. reject unknown `v`, missing `syncedAt`, stale `syncedAt`, wrong `source`;
3. validate `roles` against `VALID_ROLES` and **drop** anything else — never rely
   on mapper passthrough;
4. return `[]` on every rejection, and distinguish the reasons in a log line so
   "stale" is not silently identical to "no roles";
5. **validate its own options at construction and throw.** The staleness horizon
   is supplied at wiring time by four separate apps (§5), so a bad value is a
   live failure mode, not a hypothetical: `3 * Number(process.env.SOMETHING) * 60_000`
   with the variable unset is `NaN`, and every comparison against `NaN` is
   `false` — which turns both the staleness and skew checks into silent no-ops
   that still report healthy. `??` does not guard this; it only guards
   `undefined`/`null`. Require finite and non-negative, and **throw rather than
   defaulting** — a silent fallback reproduces the same class of bug one layer
   down. A misconfigured security control should refuse to start.

It ships with tests. Note that `@cogs/auth` currently has **no** per-plugin tests
at all (`packages/auth/test/` covers mapping, orchestrator, roles, verify,
impersonation only), so this is also the first one.

---

## 4. Break-glass does not live in the claim

`@cogs/auth`'s own guidance (`types.ts:5-8`) is that authority beyond the tenant
vocabulary is "resolved out-of-band and never encoded as a JWT-derived
`AuthRole`." A break-glass bit inside `app_metadata` contradicts that — it would
be JWT-derived by construction, and it would sit in the subtree the reconciler
overwrites.

**Break-glass is a server-side table lookup**, not a claim. This also resolves
the rolodex self-targeting problem (plan Phase 3.4): the root of trust is a row
the reconcile loop cannot write.

---

## 5. Consumers to update

Every app that reads roles must be updated in the same change set, because a
missing plugin silently degrades to `org:viewer` rather than failing:

| repo         | file                                    | today                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| rolodex      | `apps/api/src/auth/middleware.ts:60-70` | `IdpToken` + `Database`            |
| helmsman     | `apps/api/src/auth/middleware.ts:55-60` | `IdpToken` + `Database`            |
| warden       | `apps/api/src/auth/middleware.ts:70-75` | `IdpToken` + `Database`            |
| chorus       | `apps/api/src/auth/middleware.ts:55-60` | `IdpToken` + `Database`            |
| yellow-pages | `apps/api/src/auth/middleware.ts:91-99` | bespoke `claimsToRbac`, no plugins |

yellow-pages is the odd one out and is Phase 1's job.

**Also decide:** `IdpTokenPlugin` is enabled by default in all four and reads a
top-level `roles` claim (`config.ts:93`, `orchestrator.ts:72`). It is a second,
unnamespaced grant source that the reconciler neither writes nor can revoke.
Recommendation: **disable it** on these four unless something demonstrably needs
it. That is a behaviour change to a live auth path and wants its own verification.

---

## 6. Decisions (signed off 2026-07-31)

All five settled. This doc is now the contract, not a proposal.

1. **Path is `app_metadata.fleetworks`**, shape per §1.
2. **Staleness = 3× the reconcile period, and stale means _ignore the subtree_** —
   fall back to local `org_members`. Explicitly **not** a demotion to
   `org:viewer`: flooring would strip a locally-granted admin during a rolodex
   outage, contradicting the union precedence that exists to prevent exactly
   that. Accepted cost: a stale grant that should have been revoked persists if
   it also exists locally. Local revocation is the answer there, not staleness.
3. **Build `FleetworksClaimPlugin`** (§3) rather than configure `SupabasePlugin`.
   Configuration cannot enforce staleness at all, and its failure mode — missing
   subtree indistinguishable from no roles — is the silent-success shape this
   project keeps getting bitten by.
4. **Break-glass is a server-side table, not a claim** (§4).
5. **Disable `IdpTokenPlugin` on all four AuthRole apps.** It reads a top-level
   `roles` claim (`config.ts:93`) that the reconciler can neither write nor
   revoke — the same class of hole as yellow-pages' legacy `role`/`is_admin` bit.
   Nothing emits that claim today (the custom access token hook is off, though
   see plan §1.7 — that is unverified), so the blast radius is currently low and
   one config change from live. This is a behaviour change to a live auth path in
   four production repos and gets its own verification, per the adversarial gate.

### Consequent build order

`FleetworksClaimPlugin` + its tests must land in `@cogs/auth` **before** Phase 3
touches any app's middleware, because Phase 3's edit is "swap `IdpToken` for
`FleetworksClaim`" — a single change per app rather than two.
