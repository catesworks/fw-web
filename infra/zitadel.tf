#
# READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION. ORG_OWNER_VIEWER, deliberately NOT
# ORG_USER_MANAGER: verified against Zitadel's own cmd/defaults.yaml
# role-permission mapping, ORG_OWNER_VIEWER grants user.read + user.global.read
# (plus read-only org/idp/action/flow/project/policy) with ZERO write or delete
# permissions. ORG_USER_MANAGER would additionally grant user.write,
# user.delete, user.grant.write/delete and session.delete — none of which this
# read path needs, and unnecessary privilege on a production credential.
#
# BLAST RADIUS, stated honestly: all 5 Fleetworks apps share one Zitadel org
# (var.zitadel_org_id), so this credential can list EVERY Fleetworks user across
# all 5 apps, not just yellow-pages'. That is wider than the Supabase
# service-role key it replaces (scoped to yellow-pages' own project). Accepted
# because Zitadel's permission model offers no narrower role, and the credential

# chorus's own LHCI account -- deliberately NOT the shared lhci_test above

# invariant). Matches the existing production users.email row for
# lhci-test@chorus.fleetworks.dev exactly, so Phase 4's providerSubject
# backfill (US-006) correlates against a real identity instead of leaving

# Removed 2026-10-05: lhci_seed_bot and lhci_login_client (machine users, the
# lhci_login_client IAM_LOGIN_CLIENT membership, both PATs and their outputs).
# They fed the deprecated ZITADEL_SEED_BOT_PAT + ZITADEL_LOGIN_CLIENT_PAT pair
# that the prod APIs no longer read. The seed-bot PAT was revoked by hand in the
# Console; the Lighthouse mint now uses ZITADEL_TEST_MINT_PAT, a login-client-only
# `test-mint` machine user created in the Console (fleetworks fw-monorepo
# docs/runbooks/zitadel-prod-rollout.md, Part A). Applying this change destroys
# the two Terraform-managed users and their PATs; the seed-bot PAT was already
# deleted by hand, so state still lists it: expect a refresh-time "not found" for
# that one resource (provider drops it from state), not an error.
