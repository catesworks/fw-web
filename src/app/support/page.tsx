            {SUPPORT_EMAIL}
          </a>{' '}
          and we aim to reply within two business days. Include your account email, which app you
          were using, and what you were doing when the problem happened.

        <h2 className={styles.sectionHeadline}>Per-app support</h2>
        <p className={styles.body}>
          Each app has its own support page with sign-in help specific to it:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.appList}>
          {APPS.map((app) => (
            <li key={app.id} className={styles.appItem}>
              <a href={`${app.url}/support`} className={styles.link}>
                <span className={styles.appName}>{app.name}</span>
              </a>{' '}
              <span className={styles.muted}>— {app.description}</span>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>

        <h2 className={styles.sectionHeadline}>Signing in</h2>
        <p className={styles.body}>
          The mobile apps are companions to their web applications, not standalone products — each
          one needs an account on that app&apos;s instance. Sign-in, sign-up, and password reset are
          protected by a Cloudflare Turnstile challenge, which normally resolves on its own within a
          few seconds; a restrictive corporate network or VPN can block it.
        </p>

        <h2 className={styles.sectionHeadline}>Deleting your account and data</h2>
        <p className={styles.body}>
          Email{' '}
          <a href={`mailto:${SUPPORT_EMAIL}`} className={styles.link}>
            {SUPPORT_EMAIL}
          </a>{' '}
          from your account address, naming the app, and ask for deletion. Your account and the
          personal data attached to it are removed, and we confirm once it is done.
        </p>
